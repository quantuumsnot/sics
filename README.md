Sales and Inventory Control System v0.1 codename "Baby steps"


This web-based system works and locally using PHP's built-in server (started in project's directory):
php -S 127.0.0.1:65000 (assuming 65000 is not used network port)


TODO list:
1. ~~Manual or automatic check for products that are almost 'out of stock'~~
2. ~~Automatic check for missing product info or pictures~~
3. Server-side input filtering and sanitization ... because hackers
4. Database replication on-the-fly (sometimes hard drives die, you know)
5. User authentication and access levels ... because stupid users
6. UI improvements (I feel this will be a long battle against CSS)
7. Database encryption (if it's plausible in SQLite)
8. Finding where is my left sock (the grayish one that was whitey 3 years ago)
9. World domination
10. ~~Do nothing~~
11. Uploading products from excel/json/txt lists
12. Integration with the popular online shopping platforms (this is huge, think I probably can't handle at least half of that)
13. ~~Customer banlist feature ... because those rats deserve it!~~
14. Security and performance tests (y'all just buy faster computors)
15. Sales report by the end of the day
16. ~~Website localisation~~
17. Almost forgot about adding the feature for product updates like price, info, etc ... My bad
18. Sales statistics (almost forgot this feature, it's very important according to traders)
19. Automated competition intelligence (Also very important feature, it's mainly an item price comparison against other sites)
