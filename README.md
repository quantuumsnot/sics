Sales and Inventory Control System v0.1 codename "Baby steps"


This web-based system works and locally using PHP's built-in server (started in project's directory):
php -S 127.0.0.1:65000 (assuming 65000 is not used network port)


TODO list:
1. Manual or automatic check for products that are almost 'out of stock'
2. Automatic check for missing product info or pictures
3. Server-side input filtering and sanitization ... because hackers
4. Database replication on-the-fly (sometimes hard drives die, you know)
5. User authentication and access levels ... because stupid users
6. UI improvements
7. Database encryption (if it's plausible in SQLite)
8. Finding where is my left sock
9. World domination
10. ~~Do nothing~~
11. Uploading products from excel/json/txt lists
12. Integration with the popular online shopping platforms (this is huge, think I probably can't handle that)
13. ~~Customer banlist feature because those rats deserve it!~~
14. Security and performance tests (y'all just buy faster computors)
